Aim:
The aim of this program is to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players using Python. 
The game allows players to alternately mark positions on a 3x3 board with either 'X' or 'O', and determines the winner or declares a draw when the game ends.

Algorithm:
The program follows these steps to execute the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Initialization:
Create two arrays xState and zState, initialized with zeros, to represent the board state for player 'X' and player 'O' respectively.
Define the win conditions in a list wins, which contains all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).
Set a turn variable to track which player is making a move (1 for 'X', 0 for 'O').
2. Gameplay Loop:
Display the Board:
Use the printBoard function to show the current state of the board.
Replace positions with 'X', 'O', or their corresponding indices if unoccupied.
Player's Turn:
Based on turn, allow the respective player to input a position (0-8) where they want to mark.
Update the state array (xState or zState) based on the chosen position.
Win or Draw Check:
Use the checkWin function to evaluate if either player has won:
Check all possible win conditions in wins to see if the sum of the player's marks in any condition equals 3.
If a win is detected, announce the winner and terminate the game.
If no player wins and the board is full (total_turns reaches 0), declare the game as a draw.
Switch Turns:
Alternate the turn variable between 1 and 0 to switch players.
3. End the Game:
Display the final state of the board and terminate the program.
Execution Steps:
Input:
Players alternately enter numbers from 0 to 8 to mark positions on the board.
Output:
The program displays the board after each move, announces the winner if a player meets a win condition, or declares a draw if all positions are filled without a winner.
