Aim:
The aim of this Prolog program is to define and query the date of birth of individuals. 
The program provides a date_of_birth/2 predicate that maps a person's name to their date of birth using facts (dob/2). 
This allows for querying and retrieving the date of birth of specific individuals in a knowledge base.

Algorithm:
Define the Knowledge Base:
Use facts (dob(Name, DateOfBirth)) to store the name and date of birth of individuals.
Define a Rule for Generalization:
Create a rule date_of_birth(Name, DateOfBirth) that links to the facts dob/2.
Query the Knowledge Base:
Use the rule date_of_birth/2 to query the date of birth of any individual by name.
Execution:
When a query is made, Prolog matches the Name with the defined facts and retrieves the corresponding DateOfBirth.

CODE:
dob(john, '1990-05-15').
dob(alice, '1985-12-30').
dob(michael, '1995-08-20').
dob(susan, '1978-03-10').
dob(peter, '2000-11-05').
date_of_birth(Name, DateOfBirth) :-
    dob(Name, DateOfBirth).
