Aim:to write prolog program to suggest dieting System Based on Disease
Algorithm:
1. Define a knowledge base listing diseases and their corresponding diet recommendations.  
2. Store diet recommendations as facts in the knowledge base.  
3. Accept user input for their disease.  
4. Match the user's disease input with the defined facts in the knowledge base.  
5. Retrieve and display the diet recommendation for the matched disease.  
6. Handle cases where the disease is not recognized by displaying an appropriate message.
Program:
% Knowledge Base
diet(sugar_diabetes, [low_sugar, high_fiber, balanced_carbs, fresh_vegetables]).
diet(hypertension, [low_salt, low_fat, high_potassium, fresh_fruits]).
diet(heart_disease, [low_fat, omega_3_rich, whole_grains, nuts]).
diet(obesity, [low_calorie, high_fiber, low_fat, protein_rich]).
diet(anemia, [iron_rich, vitamin_c_rich, leafy_greens, lean_meat]).

% Rule to get a diet recommendation based on disease
suggest_diet(Disease, Diet) :-
    diet(Disease, Diet).

% Starting Point
start :-
    write('Enter your disease (sugar_diabetes, hypertension, heart_disease, obesity, anemia): '),
    read(Disease),
    (   
        suggest_diet(Disease, Diet) ->
        format('Suggested Diet for ~w: ~w~n', [Disease, Diet]);
        write('Disease not recognized. Please try again.')
    ).
Sample Input:
Enter your disease (sugar_diabetes, hypertension, heart_disease, obesity, anemia): sugar_diabetes.
Sample Output:
Suggested Diet for sugar_diabetes: [low_sugar, high_fiber, balanced_carbs, fresh_vegetables]
Result:
thus we written prolog program for suggesting dieting system based on disease.
