Aim
To calculate the sum of the first 𝑁
N natural numbers using a mathematical formula in Prolog.

Algorithm
Understand the Mathematical Formula:
The sum of the first 𝑁
N natural numbers can be calculated directly using the formula:
Sum=(𝑁+1)×𝑁2 
This formula avoids iterative summation and provides a direct result.
Define a Prolog Rule:
Define a rule sum(N, Sum) where:
N is the input number (up to which the sum is calculated).
Sum is the output, calculated using the formula.
Implementation in Prolog:
Use the is keyword to perform arithmetic operations.

sum(N, Sum) :-
    Sum is (N + 1) * N / 2.
