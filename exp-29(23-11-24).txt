Aim:to Write Prolog Program Medical Diagnosis
### **Algorithm**
1. Define symptoms and corresponding diseases in the knowledge base.  
2. Accept user input for symptoms they are experiencing.  
3. Match the provided symptoms with diseases using predefined rules.  
4. Suggest potential diagnoses based on the symptoms.  
5. Handle cases where no matching disease is found.  
### **Prolog Code**
% Facts: Diseases and their associated symptoms
disease(flu, [fever, cough, sore_throat, fatigue]).
disease(cold, [cough, runny_nose, sneezing]).
disease(covid, [fever, cough, shortness_of_breath, loss_of_taste_or_smell]).
disease(malaria, [fever, chills, sweating, headache]).
disease(allergy, [sneezing, runny_nose, itchy_eyes]).

% Rule to find possible diseases based on symptoms
diagnose(Symptoms, Disease) :-
    disease(Disease, DiseaseSymptoms),
    subset(Symptoms, DiseaseSymptoms).

% Subset helper function
subset([], _).
subset([H | T], List) :-
    member(H, List),
    subset(T, List).

% Starting point
start :-
    write('Enter your symptoms as a list (e.g., [fever, cough]): '),
    read(Symptoms),
    findall(Disease, diagnose(Symptoms, Disease), PossibleDiseases),
    (   
        PossibleDiseases \= [] ->
        format('Possible diseases based on your symptoms: ~w~n', [PossibleDiseases]);
        write('No matching disease found. Please consult a doctor.')
    ).
**Input**:  
   ```
   Enter your symptoms as a list (e.g., [fever, cough]): [fever, cough].
**Output**:  
   ```
   Possible diseases based on your symptoms: [flu, covid]
Result:
thus we written a prolog for medical diagnosis
