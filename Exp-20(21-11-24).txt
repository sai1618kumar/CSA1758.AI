Aim:
The aim of this Prolog program is to define and query the properties of planets in our solar system.
The planet_properties/4 predicate allows users to retrieve or specify information about a planet, including its name, type, size, and temperature.


Algorithm:
Define the Knowledge Base:
Use facts planet(Name, Type, Size, Temperature) to store details about each planet:
Name: Name of the planet (e.g., mercury, venus).
Type: Classification of the planet (e.g., rocky, gas giant, ice giant).
Size: Relative size of the planet (e.g., small, medium, large).
Temperature: Temperature conditions on the planet (e.g., hot, cold).
Define a General Rule:
Use the rule planet_properties(Name, Type, Size, Temperature) to allow querying the planet's properties. This rule directly references the planet/4 facts.
Query the Knowledge Base:
To find specific details about a planet, query using planet_properties/4 with known or unknown parameters.
Execution:
Prolog matches the query with the relevant facts in planet/4 to retrieve the requested information.


CODE:
planet(mercury,rocky,small,hot).
planet(venus,rocky,small,hot).
planet(earth,rocky,small,moderate).
planet(mars,rocky,small,cold).
planet(jupiter,gas_gaint,large,very_hot).
planet(saturn,gas_gaint,large,hot).
planet(uranus,ice_gaint,medium,cold).
planet(neptune,ice_gaint,medium,very_cold).
planet_properties(Name,Type,Size,Temperature):-
planet(Name,Type,Size,Temperature).
