Aim:
The aim of this Prolog program is to provide diet suggestions based on specific diseases.
By defining facts about dietary recommendations for various diseases, the program enables querying for appropriate diets tailored to individual health conditions.


Algorithm:
Define Facts:
Use diet_suggestion/2 to map each disease to a corresponding list of recommended foods.
Disease: Name of the disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
Diet: List of recommended foods for managing the disease.
Define Rule:
Diet Suggestion Rule: suggest_diet(Disease, Diet) states that Diet is suggested for Disease if it matches a predefined diet_suggestion/2 fact.
Query the Knowledge Base:
Use suggest_diet/2 with a specific disease to retrieve the corresponding dietary recommendations.
Execution:
When queried with a disease, Prolog matches the input against the diet_suggestion/2 facts and returns the list of recommended foods.


CODE:
diet_suggestion(diabetes, ['High-fiber foods', 'Whole grains', 'Non-starchy vegetables', 'Lean protein', 'Healthy fats']).
diet_suggestion(hypertension, ['Low-sodium foods', 'Fruits and vegetables', 'Whole grains', 'Lean protein', 'Healthy fats']).
% Define predicate to suggest diet based on disease
suggest_diet(Disease, Diet) :-
    diet_suggestion(Disease, Diet).
