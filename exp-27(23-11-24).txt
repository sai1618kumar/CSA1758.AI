Aim:To write a Prolog Program for fruit and its color using for backtracking
Algorithm :


1. Define facts associating fruits with their colors.  
2. Accept a query to find the color of a specific fruit.  
3. Use backtracking to explore all possible matches in the knowledge base.  
4. Display the color of the queried fruit or state that it is not found.

### **Code**:
% Facts: Fruit and their colors
fruit_color(apple, red).
fruit_color(banana, yellow).
fruit_color(grape, purple).
fruit_color(orange, orange).
fruit_color(kiwi, green).

% Rule to find the color of a fruit
find_color(Fruit, Color) :-
    fruit_color(Fruit, Color).

% Starting Point
start :-
    write('Enter the name of the fruit: '),
    read(Fruit),
    (
        find_color(Fruit, Color) ->
        format('The color of ~w is ~w.~n', [Fruit, Color]);
        write('Fruit not found. Please try again.')
    ),
    write('Do you want to check another fruit? (yes/no): '),
    read(Choice),
    (
        Choice = yes -> start;
        write('Goodbye!'), nl
    ).
```

### **Sample Interaction**

 **Input**:  
   ```
   Enter the name of the fruit: apple.
   ```

 **Output**:  
   ```
   The color of apple is red.
   Do you want to check another fruit? (yes/no): yes.
   ```
