Aim:
The aim of this Prolog program is to manage and query information about students and teachers. Specifically, it maps:
->Subjects studied by students via subjects_studied_by_student/3.
->Subjects taught by teachers via subjects_taught_by_teacher/3.

Algorithm:
Define the Knowledge Base:
Use facts student_subject(Student, Subject, Code) to associate students with the subjects they study and the subject codes.
Use facts teacher_subject(Teacher, Subject, Code) to associate teachers with the subjects they teach and the subject codes.
Define Rules:
Use the rule subjects_studied_by_student(Student, Subject, Code) to generalize student queries by directly linking to the student_subject/3 facts.
Use the rule subjects_taught_by_teacher(Teacher, Subject, Code) to generalize teacher queries by directly linking to the teacher_subject/3 facts.
Query the Knowledge Base:
To find out which subjects a student studies, query using subjects_studied_by_student/3 with the student's name.
To find out which subjects a teacher teaches, query using subjects_taught_by_teacher/3 with the teacher's name.
