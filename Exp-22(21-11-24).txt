Aim
To determine whether a given bird can fly using a Prolog program that queries a predefined database of birds, and handles cases where the bird is unknown.

Algorithm
Define Facts:
bird(Bird, CanFly).
Example:
bird(canary, yes).
bird(ostrich, no).
bird(sparrow, yes).
bird(penguin, no).
bird(eagle, yes).
Implementation:
Rule to check if the bird can fly:
can_fly(Bird) :-
    bird(Bird, yes),
    write(Bird), write(' can fly.'), nl.
Execution:
Query the can_fly/1 predicate with the name of a bird to determine its flying ability or if it is unknown:


CODE:
% Query to check if a bird can fly.
can_fly(Bird) :-
    bird(Bird, yes),
    write(Bird), write(' can fly.'), nl.
can_fly(Bird) :-
    bird(Bird, no),
    write(Bird), write(' cannot fly.'), nl.
can_fly(Bird) :-
    \+ bird(Bird, _),
    write('Unknown bird: '), write(Bird), nl.
